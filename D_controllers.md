##Controller Guide

Phoenix controllers act as a sort of intermediary modules. Their functions - called actions - are invoked from the router in response to HTTP requests. The actions, in turn, gather all the necessary data and perform all the necessary steps before - in a typical case - invoking the view layer to render a template.

A newly generated Phoenix app will have a single controller, the PageController, which looks like this.

```elixir
defmodule HelloPhoenix.PageController do
  use Phoenix.Controller

  plug :action

  def index(conn, _params) do
    render conn, "index.html"
  end

  def not_found(conn, _params) do
    render conn, "not_found.html"
  end

  def error(conn, _params) do
    render conn, "error.html"
  end
end
```
Important! This controller has been generated from the master branch. Until Phoenix version 0.5.0, template names in render calls did not need any file extensions. The templates above would simply be "index", "not_found", and "error". In both master and 0.5.0, we can use atoms instead of strings for template names, `:index`, `:not_found`, and `:error`.

The first line below the module definition invokes the `__using__/1` macro of the `Phoenix.Controller` module, which imports some useful modules.

The second line `plug :action` has been recently added with the 0.5.0 release of Phoenix. `plug/1` is a macro defined in the `Phoenix.Controller.Pipeline` module. Its purpose is to insert a new piece of middleware into the stack of middlewares which will be executed, in order, during a request cycle. Here, it is inserting `:action` which handles dispatching to the correct controller module and function (in other words, the action) according to the routes defined in the router.

In addition, the `PageController` gives us the index action to display the Phoenix welcome page associated with the default route Phoenix defines in the router. It also gives us generic actions to handle 404 Page not Found and 500 Internal Error responses.

###Actions
Controller actions are just functions. We can name them anything we like as long as they follow Elixir's  naming rules. The only requirement we need to be sure to fulfill is that the action name matches a route defined in the router.

For example, we could change the action name in the default route that Phoenix gives us in a new app from index:

```elixir
get "/", Test.PageController, :index, as: :pages
```

To test:

```elixir
get "/", Test.PageController, :test, as: :pages
```

As long as we change the action name in the PageController to "test" as well, the welcome page will load as before.

```elixir
def test(conn, _params) do
 render conn, "index"
end
```

While we can name our actions whatever we like, there are conventions for action names which we should follow whenever possible. We went over these in the Routing Guide, but we'll take another quick look here.

- index   - renders a list of all items of the given resource type
- show    - renders an individual item by id
- new     - renders a form for creating a new item
- create  - receives params for one new item and saves it in a datastore
- edit    - retrieves and individual item by id and displays it in a form for editing
- update  - receives params for one edited item and saves it to a datastore
- destroy - receives an id for an item to be deleted and deletes it from a datastore

Each of these actions takes two parameters, which will be provided by Phoenix behind the scenes.

The first parameter is always `conn`, a struct which holds information about the request such as the host, path elements, port, query string, and much more. `conn`, comes to Phoenix via Elixir's plug middleware framework. More detailed info about `conn` can be found in plug's documentation, here: http://elixir-lang.org/docs/plug/Plug.Conn.html

The second parameter is `params`. Not surprisingly, this is a map which holds any parameters passed along in the HTTP request. It is a good practice to pattern match against params in the function signature to provide data in a simple package we can pass on to rendering. We saw this in the Adding Pages guide when we added a messenger parameter to our show route.

```elixir
def show(conn, %{"messenger" => messenger}) do
  render conn, "show", messenger: messenger
end
```

In some cases - often in index actions, for instance - we don't care about parameters because our behavior doesn't depend on them. In those cases, we don't use the incoming params, and simply prepend the variable name with an underscore, `_params`. This will keep the compiler from complaining about the unused variable while still keeping the correct arity. We see this in all the actions of the default PageController which Phoenix generates for us.

###Gathering Data
While Phoenix does not ship with its own data access layer, the Elixir project Ecto provides a very nice solution for those using the Postgres relational database. (Other adapters for Ecto are coming soon.) We cover how to use Ecto in a Phoenix project in the Data Access guide.

Of course, there are many other data access options. Ets and Dets are key value data stores built into OTP. OTP also provides a relational database called mnesia  with its own query language called QLC. Both Elixir and Erlang also have a number of libraries for working with a wide range of popular data stores.

The data world is your oyster, but we won't be covering these options in the Phoenix Guides.

###Flash Messages

There are times when we need to communicate with users during the course of an action. Maybe there was an error updating a model. Maybe we just want to welcome them back to the application. For this, we have flash messages.

In order to use flash messages, we first alias the `Phoenix.Controller.Flash` module in the controller we want to set messages in.

```elixir
defmodule HelloPhoenix.PageController do
  use Phoenix.Controller
  alias Phoenix.Controller.Flash
. . .
```
Now we can use `Flash.put/3` to set flash messages on `conn` for this request cycle. We could change the `PageController` index action to set a notice and an error.

```elixir
def index(conn, _params) do
  conn
  |> Flash.put(:notice, "Welcome to Phoenix, from a flash notice!")
  |> Flash.put(:error, "Let's pretend we have an error.")
  |> render "index"
end
```

The `Phoenix.Controller.Flash` module is not particular about the keys we use. As long as we are internally consistent, all will be well. "notice", "error", and "alert", however, are common.

In order to see our flash messages, we need to be able to pull them off of the `conn` and display them all in a template/layout. One way to do the first part is with `get_all/2` which takes `conn` and the key we care about and returns a list of values for that key.

Let's put these blocks in our application layout. They are designed to work if we have one or many messages set on each key.

```html
<%= for error <- Flash.get_all(@conn, :error) do %>
      <div class="flash_error">
        <div class="row">
          <p><%= error %></p>
        </div>
      </div>
 <% end %>

 <%= for notice <- Flash.get_all(@conn, :notice) do %>
       <div class="flash_notice">
         <div class="row">
           <p><%= notice %></p>
         </div>
       </div>
  <% end %>
```

 When we reload the page, our messages should appear.

 Besides `put/3` and `get_all/2`, the `Phoenix.Controller.Flash` module has some other useful functions worth looking into. The doc strings embedded in the source code have examples.

 `persist/2` takes `conn` and a key, and allows us to save flash messages for that key in the session so that they can persist beyond the current request cycle.

 `get/2` also takes `conn` and a key, but only returns a single value.

 `clear/1` takes only `conn` and removes any flash messages in the session.

 `pop_all/2` also takes `conn` and a key, and returns a tuple containing a list of values and `conn`.

### Rendering
Controllers have several ways of rendering content. The simplest is to render some plain text. Phoenix provides the `text/2` function for just this.

Let's say we have a show action which receives an id from the params map, and all we want to do is return some text with the id. For that, we could do the following.

```elixir
def show(conn, %{"id" => id}) do
  text conn, "Showing id #{id}"
end
```
Assuming we had a route for `get "/our_path/:id"` mapped to this show action, going to "/our_path/15" in your browser should display "Showing id 15" as plain text without any HTML.

A step beyond this is rendering pure json. Phoenix provides the `json/2` function for this. The example below used the built-in `JSON.encode!` function.

```elixir
def show(conn, %{"id" => id}) do
  json conn, JSON.encode!(%{id: id})
end
```
If we again visit "our_path/15" in the browser, we should see a block of JSON with the key "id" mapped to the number 15.

```elixir
{
  id: 15
}
```

Phoenix controllers can also render HTML without a template. As you may have already guessed, the `html/2` function does just that. This time, we implement the show action like this.

```elixir
def show(conn, %{"id" => id}) do
  html conn, """
     <html>
       <head>
          <title>Passing an Id</title>
       </head>
       <body>
         <p>You sent in id #{id}></p>
       </body>
     </html>
    """
end
```

Hitting "/our_path/15" this time generates the HTML document as we created the string for in the action, except that the value "15" will be interpolated into the page. Note that what we wrote in the action is not an eex document. It's a multi-line string, so we interpolate the `id` variable like this `#{id}` instead of this `<%= id %>`.

It is worth noting that the `text/2`, `json/2`, and `html/2` functions require neither a Phoenix view, nor a template to render.

The `json/2` function is obviously useful for writing APIs, and the other two may come in handy, but rendering a template into a layout with values we pass in is a very common case.

For this, Phoenix provides the `render/3` function.

Interestingly, `render/3` is defined in the `Phoenix.View` module instead of `Phoenix.Controller`, but it is aliased in `Phoenix.Controller` for convenience.

We have already seen the render function in the "Adding Pages Guide". Our show action there looked like this.

```elixir
defmodule HelloPhoenix.HelloController do
  use Phoenix.Controller

  plug :action

  def show(conn, %{"messenger" => messenger}) do
    render conn, "show", messenger: messenger
  end
end
```

The `render/3` function will derive the name of a template to render from the name of the view it is called from and the basename we pass in. The view must have the same root name as the controller for this to work properly. In this case, that would be `/web/templates/hello/show.html.eex`. `render/3` will also pass the value which the show action received for messenger from the params hash into the template for interpolation.

There is also a shortcut for rendering which uses a plug for rendering. Here's how.

The first thing we need to do is to add a `plug :render` line to our controller.

```elixir
defmodule HelloPhoenix.PageController do
  use Phoenix.Controller

  plug :action
  plug :render

. . .
```

After that we can omit the render call in our actions as long as we return `conn` either directly or as the return value of a function.

In a new Phoenix app, try plugging render and then replacing the index action with this.

```elixir
def index(conn, _params) do
  conn
end
```

After restarting our local server and viewing the root route in our browser, we should see the "Welcome to Phoenix!" page exactly as we did when we explicitly rendered the index template.

Just as `plug :action` inserted a plug for dispatching to the correct module/function in a controller's plug stack, `plug :render` inserts a rendering plug in the stack for us. In essence, we've just moved rendering to a different layer.

If we need to pass values into the template when using `plug :render`, that's easy. We can use `Plug.Conn.assign/3`, which conveniently returns `conn`.

```elixir
def index(conn, _params) do
  assign(conn, :message, "Welcome Back!")
end
```

We can access this message in our `index.html.eex` template like this `<%= @message %>`, anywhere we would like.

The `Phoenix.Controller` module imports `Plug.Conn`, so shortening the call to `assign/3` works just fine.

Passing more than one value in to our template is as simple as connecting `assign/3` functions together in a pipeline.

```elixir
def index(conn, _params) do
  conn
  |> assign(:message, "Welcome Back!")
  |> assign(:name, "Dweezil")
end
```

With this, both `@message` and `@name` will be availale in the `index.html.eex` template.

What if we want to plug render, but only some of our actions should actually call `render/2`? For example, some actions might need to do a redirect, or return json.

By default, the render plug takes over all rendering for all actions in a controller. Once we plug render, if we try to use any rendering-style function in any action - `text/2`, `json/2`, `html/2`, `render/2` or even `redirect/2`- we will get errors if that action is dispatched to. Even if the application appears to do the right thing, the server will be throwing errors.

Phoenix offers a solution to this by letting us specify which actions `plug :render` should be applied to. If we only wanted `plug :render` to work on the `index` and `show` actions, we could do this.

```elixir
defmodule HelloPhoenix.PageController do
  use Phoenix.Controller

  plug :action
  plug :render  when action in [:index, :show]

. . .
```

Then we are free to call any of the rendering-style functions in any other actions besides `index` and `show` in `HelloPhoenix.PageController` without generating errors.

Rendering does not end with the template, though. By default, the results of the template render will be inserted into a layout, which will also be rendered.

Templates and layouts have their own guide, so we won't spend much time on them here. What we will look at is how to assign a different layout, or none at all, inside a controller action.

### Assigning Layouts

Layouts are just a special subset of templates. They live in `/web/templates/layout`. Phoenix created one for us when we generated our app. It's called `application.html.eex`, and it is the layout into which all templates will be rendered by default.

Since layouts are really just templates, they need a view to render them. This is the `LayoutView` module defined in `/web/views/layout_view.ex`. Since Phoenix generated this view for us, we won't have to create a new one as long as we put the layouts we want to render inside the `/web/templates/layout` directory.

Before we create a new layout, though, let's do the simplest possible thing and render a template with no layout at all.

The `Phoenix.Controller.Connection` module provides the `put_layout/2` function for us to switch layouts with. (Note: in release 0.4.1 and earlier, this was `assign_layout/2`.) This takes `conn` as its first argument and a string for the basename of the layout we want to render as the second. Another clause of the fuction will match on the atom `:none` for the second argument, and that's how we will render the Phoenix welcome page with no layout at all.

In a freshly generated Phoenix app, edit the index action of the `PageController` module to look like this.

```elixir
def index(conn, params) do
  conn
  |> put_layout(:none)
  |> render "index"
end
```
When you start the application and view `http://localhost:4000/`, you should see a very different page, one with no title, logo image, or css styling at all.

Very Important! For function calls in the middle of a pipeline, like `put_layout/2` here, it is critical to use parenthesis around the arguments because the pipeline operator binds more tightly. This leads to parsing problems and very strange results.

If you ever get a stack trace that looks like this,

```text
**(FunctionClauseError) no function clause matching in Plug.Conn.get_resp_header/2

Stacktrace

    (plug) lib/plug/conn.ex:353: Plug.Conn.get_resp_header(:none, "content-type")
```

where your argument replaces `conn` as the first argument, one of the first things to check is whether there are parens in the right places.

This is fine.

```elixir
def index(conn, params) do
  conn
  |> put_layout(:none)
  |> render "index"
end
```

This won't work.

```elixir
def index(conn, params) do
  conn
  |> put_layout :none
  |> render "index"
end
```

Now let's actually create another layout and render the index template into it. As an example, let's say we had a different layout for the admin section of our application which didn't have the logo image. To do this, let's copy the existing `application.html.eex` to a new file `admin.html.eex`. Then remove the line in it that displays the logo.

```html
<span class="logo"></span> <!-- remove this line -->
```

Then, pass the basename of the new layout into `put_layout/2` in our index action.

```elixir
def index(conn, params) do
  conn
  |> put_layout("admin")
  |> render "index"
end
```

Reload the page, and we should be rendering the admin layout with no logo.

### Overriding Rendering Formats

Rendering HTML through a template is fine, but what if we need to change the rendering format on the fly? Let's say that sometimes we need HTML, sometimes we need plain text, and sometimes we need JSON. Then what?

Phoenix allows us to change formats on the fly with the `format` query string parameter. To make this  happen, Phoenix requires an appropriately named view and an appropriately named template in the correct directory.

Let's take the `PageController` index action from a newly generated app as an example. Out of the box, this has the right view, `PageView`, the right templates directory, `/web/templates/page`, and the right template for rendering HTML, `application.html.eex`.

```elixir
def index(conn, _params) do
  render conn, "index"
end
```

What it doesn't have is a new template for rendering text. Let's add one at `/web/templates/page/index.txt.eex`.

There are two things to note about this. The first is that even though we will call it with `?format=text`, we need to shorten "text" in the template name to "txt".

The second is that we need to have a compilable template. That would be eex by default. Without the `.eex` file extension, Phoenix will not recognize that a text template exists, and it will complain if we try to use it.

Here is our example `index.txt.eex` template.

```elixir
"OMG, this is actually some text."
```
If we go to `http://localhost:4000/?format=text`, we will see "OMG, this is actually some text."

Of course, we can pass data into our template as well. Let's change our action to take in a message parameter.

```elixir
def index(conn, params) do
  render conn, "index", message: params["message"]
end
```

And let's add a bit to out text template.

```elixir
"OMG, this is actually some text." <%= @message %>
```
Now if we go to `http://localhost:4000/?format=text&message=CrazyTown`, we will see "OMG, this is actually some text. CrazyTown"

### Setting Content Type

Analogous to the `format` query string param, we can render any sort of format we want by modifying the accepts headers and providing the appropriate template. If we wanted to render an xml version of our index action, we might implement the action like this.

```elixir
def index(conn, _params) do
  conn
  |> put_resp_content_type("text/xml")
  |> render "index", content: some_xml_content
end
```
We would then need to provide an `index.xml.eex` template which created valid xml, and we would be done.

For a list of valid content mime-types, please see the documentation from the plug middleware framework: https://github.com/elixir-lang/plug/blob/master/lib/plug/mime.types

### Setting HTTP Status

We can also set the HTTP status code of a response similarly to the way we set the content type. The `Plug.Conn` module, imported into all controllers, has a `put_status/2` function to do this. (In release 0.4.1 and before, this was `assign_status/2`)

`put_status/2` takes `conn` and either an integer or a "friendly name" used as an atom for the status code we want to set.  Here is the list of supported <a href=" https://github.com/elixir-lang/plug/blob/master/lib/plug/conn/status.ex#L7-L63">friendly names</a>.

Let's change the status in our `PageController` `index` action.

```elixir
def index(conn, _params) do
  conn
  |> put_status(202)
  |> render "index"
end
```
The status code we provide must be valid - Cowboy, the web server Phoenix runs on, will throw an error on invalid codes. If we look at our development logs, or use our browser's web inspection network tool, we will see the status code being set as we reload the page.

If the action sends a response - either renders or redirects - changing the code will not change the behavior of the response. If, for example, we set the status to 404 or 500 and then `render "index"`, we do not get an error page. Similarly, no 300 level code will actually redirect. (It wouldn't know where to redirect to, even if the code did affect behavior.)

This implementation of the `HelloPhoenix.PageController` `index` action, for example, will _not_ render the default `not_found` behavior.

```elixir
def index(conn, _params) do
  conn
  |> put_status(:not_found)
  |> render "index"
end
```

On the other hand, if we set the status code to a 404 or 500, and the action neither renders nor redirects, then we _will_ see the appropriate error page. Status codes in the 300 range still won't know where to redirect to.

This implementation of the `index` action _will_ render the default `not_found` behavior.

```elixir
def index(conn, _params) do
  conn
  |> put_status(:not_found)
end
```

Very Important! (This may seem self-evident, but it bit me.) If we remove any rendering or redirection from an action, no new response will be sent to the browser. No matter how many times we reload a page, we will see exactly the same pixels as before. This means that if we get a stack trace, then remove the `render/2` call to debug it, any fixes we try will show exactly the same stack trace no matter how many times we reload.

### Redirection

Often, we need to redirect to a new url in the middle of a request. A successful create action, for instance, will usually redirect to the show action for the model we just created. Alternately, it could redirect to the index action to show all the things of that same type. There are plenty of other cases where redirection is useful as well.

Whatever the circumstance, Phoenix controllers provide the handy `redirect/2` and `redirect/3` functions to make redirection easy.

In order to try out `redirect/2`, let's create a new route.

```elixir
get "/redirect_test", HelloPhoenix.PageController, :redirect_test, as: :redirect_tests
```

Then we'll change the `index` action to do nothing but redirect to our new route.

```elixir
def index(conn, _params) do
  redirect conn, "/redirect_test"
end
```

Finally, let's define the action we redirect to, which simply renders the text "Redirect!"

```elixir
def redirect_test(conn, _params) do
  text conn, "Redirect!"
end
```
When we reload our Welcome page at the root route, we see that we've been redirected to `/redirect_test` which has rendered the text "Redirect!". It works!

If we care to, we can open up our developer tools, click on the network tab, and visit our root route again. We see two main requests for this page - a get to "/" with a status of 302, and a get to "/redirect_test" with a status of 200.

Notice that the redirect function takes `conn` as well as a string representing a relative path within our application. It can also take `conn` and a string representing a fully-qualified url.

```elixir
def index(conn, _params) do
  redirect conn, "http://localhost:4000/redirect_test"
end
```

We can also make use of the path helpers we learned about in the Routing Guide. It's useful to alias the helpers in order to shorten the expression.

```elixir
defmodule HelloPhoenix.PageController do
  use Phoenix.Controller
  alias HelloPhoenix.Router.Helpers

  def index(conn, _params) do
    redirect conn, Helpers.redirect_tests_path(:redirect_test)
  end
end
```

The url helper works in the same way.

```elixir
def index(conn, _params) do
  redirect conn, Helpers.redirect_tests_path(:redirect_test) |> Helpers.url
end
```

`redirect/3` works the same as `redirect/2` with the addition of the ability to set a status code with the second argument.

We could easily have written our index action like this and had the exact same behavior.

```elixir
def index(conn, _params) do
  redirect conn, 302, "/redirect_test"
end
```
That's great, but what happens if we change the status code to 404?

```elixir
def index(conn, _params) do
  redirect conn, 404, "/redirect_test"
end
```

When we reload the root route, we see a new page which has rendered some minimal HTML, without our layout, telling us the page has moved. The page does offer a helpful link to the url we should be redirected to.

As it turns out, when we use any of the 300 level status codes, which represent some form of redirect, `redirect/3` will work as if we were using `redirect/2`. Any other status code - even 500 - will give us this minimal HTML page.

### Creating a Custom Errors Controller

It's quite common for applications to have custom error pages for handling status 404 "not found" and 500 "internal error" messages. Phoenix has a version of these in each freshly generated app. If we open up the `HelloPhoenix.PageController`, we'll see the `not_found/2` and `error/2` functions.

```elixir
defmodule HelloPhoenix.PageController do
  use Phoenix.Controller

  plug :action

  def index(conn, _params) do
    render conn, "index"
  end

  def not_found(conn, _params) do
    render conn, "not_found"
  end

  def error(conn, _params) do
    render conn, "error"
  end
end
```

Before we change anything, let's test the default behavior by going to a route that just doesn't exist, like this.

`http://localhost:4000/clearly_wrong`

What we see is a rendered string of text.

`No route matches GET to ["clearly_wrong"]`

Now let's see what happens when the `index` action throws an error.

```elixir
defmodule HelloPhoenix.PageController do
  use Phoenix.Controller

  plug :action

  def index(conn, _params) do
    raise "uh oh"
  end
```
When we go to `http://localhost:4000`, we get a stack trace.

```text
**(RuntimeError) uh oh

Stacktrace

    (test) web/controllers/page_controller.ex:8: Test.PageController.index/2
    (test) web/controllers/page_controller.ex:1: Test.PageController.phoenix_controller_stack/2
    (phoenix) lib/phoenix/router/adapter.ex:73: Phoenix.Router.Adapter.dispatch/2
    (test) web/router.ex:2: Test.Router.call/2
    (plug) lib/plug/adapters/cowboy/handler.ex:7: Plug.Adapters.Cowboy.Handler.init/3
    (cowboy) src/cowboy_handler.erl:64: :cowboy_handler.handler_init/4
    (cowboy) src/cowboy_protocol.erl:435: :cowboy_protocol.execute/4
```

Ok, fine, so we should be able to change the templates for the `render conn, "not_found"` and `ender conn, "error"` calls, right? Actually, no. We need to hunt a little deeper in the Phoenix source code to find where these responses are coming from.

Take a look at <a href="https://github.com/phoenixframework/phoenix/blob/master/lib/phoenix/controller/error_controller.ex">error_controller.ex</a>. There are functions called `not_found_debug/2` and `error_debug/2` that render the error messages we just saw.

By default, the development environment is configured to "debug" errors, so the `<function>_debug` functions are called. There are also two functions in the `ErrorController`, `not_found/2` and `error/2`, for handling these errors when debugging is turned off. They return text strings as well, as we can see.

In order to create a better experience for our users, what we need to do is to configure our application to not use these default functions, and to provide alternatives that meet our needs.

Let's start by opening up `/config/config.exs`. The stanza we care about now pertains to the `HelloPhoenix.Router`.

```elixir
config :phoenix, HelloPhoenix.Router,
  port: System.get_env("PORT"),
  ssl: false,
  static_assets: true,
  cookies: true,
  session_key: "_hello_phoenix_key",
  secret_key_base: "such_extra_seekrit_stuff==",
  catch_errors: true,
  debug_errors: false,
  error_controller: HelloPhoenix.PageController

The last three lines are the most pertinent. Only the very last line actually needs to change. We do want to catch errors (so that we don't show a stack trace). We do not want to debug errors. Currently, our app is configured to use `HelloPhoenix.PageController` for our errors. Let's change that to a new `HelloPhoenix.OopsController` that we will create in a minute.

```elixir
error_controller: HelloPhoenix.OopsController
```
You might think that we're done with configuration - but not so fast. If we look at the very bottom of `/config/config.exs` we see a line which will import configuration from the config file for the environment we are in.

```elixir
import_config "#{Mix.env}.exs"
```
Since we're in development, that file is `/config/dev.exs`.

```elixir
config :phoenix, HelloPhoenix.Router,
  port: System.get_env("PORT") || 4000,
  ssl: false,
  host: "localhost",
  cookies: true,
  session_key: "_hello_phoenix_key",
  secret_key_base: "such_extra_seekrit_stuff==",
  debug_errors: true
```
We need to mimic the last three lines of the general config file, like this.

```elixir
debug_errors: false,
catch_errors: true,
error_controller: HelloPhoenix.OopsController
```
Very Important! We are only changing the development config for demonstration purposes. We want to see the effect of our changes with the fewest steps. In general, we want debugging turned on, and we don't want to catch errors in development.

Now we're ready for our new error controller. In `/web/controllers` we need to create `oops_controller.ex`.

```elixir
defmodule HelloPhoenix.OopsController do
  use Phoenix.Controller

  plug :action

  def not_found(conn, _params) do
    render conn, "not_found"
  end

  def error(conn, _params) do
    render conn, "error"
  end
end
```

We also need to remove the `not_found/2` and `error/2` actions from `HelloPhoenix.PageController` since they  are superfluous.

From here on, our tasks are the same as they were in the Adding Pages Guide.

In order to render our templates, we create a new, empty view at `/web/views/oops_view.ex`.

```elixir
defmodule HelloPhoenix.OopsView do
  use HelloPhoenix.Views

end
```

Then we need a new `/web/templates/oops` directory with `not_found.html.eex` and `errors.html.eex` templates in it.

```html
<div class="jumbotron">
  <h2>Oops! Sorry, we can't seem to find that for you.</h2>
</div>
```

```html
<div class="jumbotron">
  <h2>Oops! Sorry, something went wrong.</h2>
</div>
```
Finally, since we've made a configuration changes, we need to restart our application for this to take effect.
